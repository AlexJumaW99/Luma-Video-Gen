    Imagine you are the camera (or perspective) through which I am seeing the attached image. 
    The perpendicular distance between you and the subject (pharaoh) in the photo is the radius of the circle. 
    Now move along the circumference of the circle, until you are on the opposite side. 
    You should now be viewing the same pharaoh from the opposite side (you are viewing him from the back). 
    From this new perspective (camera position), the pharaoh should still be centred in the image, 
    in the same pose as the attached generated image, and the art style should be exactly the same. 
    But he should now be facing away from us.  

    With this in mind use the attached image, to generate for me the following video:
 
    "A cinematic, eye level, 360-degree orbit shot (moving towards the left direction). 
    Revolving smoothly around the Pharaoh, who stands completely motionless in a frozen, 
    statue-like pose. After the revolution (camera orbit), 
    the user should have seen the Pharaoh from every direction 
    (frontal-view, side-views, rear-view, diagonal-views). 
    The lighting throughout the video should be photorealistic and dramatic. 
    Like the attached photo, the high-fidelity art style of the Pharaoh in the video should look like an 8k Unreal Engine 5 render with a timeless, 
    historical atmosphere. The background surrounding the Pharaoh in the video, should also be plain white."
